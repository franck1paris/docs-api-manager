= Selecting an API 
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

After you have created an API using Design Center or any other application, you can then
manage that API in API Manager by adding an API Instance.

There are three options for adding an API Instance:
* **Add a new API:** Select this option to add a completely new instance of an API.
* **Promote API from environment:** Select this option if you have an API Instance in a different environment, for instance
the sandbox environment, and you want to promote it to the current or production environment.
* **Import API from zip file:** Select this option if you have exported an API Instance from a different Anypoint Platform
instance.

When you are promoting or importing an API Instance, you will not have options to alter the configuration. However,
when you add a new API Instance, you will need to configure the endpoint as well as other settings.

== Add a New API

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the navigation bar or the Anypoint Platform page, click *API Manager*.
. Click **Add API** and select **Add new API**.
. Select and configure your runtime.
* **Flex Gateway:** Select Flex Gateway if you have non-Mule APIs that need a flexible, performant API gateway
that will work with distributed and microservices environments and fit into your CI/CD environments.
  . Choose the connected Flex Gateway you have installed and registered, and click **Next**.
+
NOTE: If you do not see a Flex Gateway, or you see a Flex Gateway but its status is DISCONNECTED,
See xref:gateway:flex-install.adoc[Install Flex Gateway] and xref:gateway:flex-conn-reg-run.adoc[Register and Run in Connected Mode] for more information.
* **Mule Gateway:** Select Mule Gateway if you have Mule APIs that need an API gateway to manage, observe,
and secure your APIs.
  . Select the **Proxy type**:
    * Connect to existing application (basic endpoint)
    * Deploy a proxy application
      . Select the **Target type**:
        * CloudHub
        * Hybrid
          . Select the ***Runtime version**.
          . Enter a **Proxy app name**.
  . Select the **Mule version**.
* **Service Mesh:** Select Service Mesh if you have multiple internal APIs that need to communicate and you want
to manage, observe, and secure those connections.
+
NOTE: After adding the API on Anypoint Platform, you will need to bind it to a service using the Anypoint Service Mesh client. See xref:service-mesh/configure-service-mesh.adoc#methods-for-configuring-anypoint-service-mesh[Methods for Configuring Anypoint Service Mesh] for more information.
. Click **Next**.
. You have two choices for selecting an API:
* Click **Select API from Exchange** if you have an API shared with you through Exchange that you want to manage.
  . Click the API from the list under **Select API**. You can search for a specific API if needed.
  . Update the Asset type, API version, and Asset version if necessary, then click **Next**.
* Click **Create new API**.
  . Enter a name for the new API asset.
  . Select the **Asset type*.
  . Optionally, you can add an **AssetId** and customize the **Version** details by clicking **Advanced**.
. Click **Next**.
. Configure the endpoint and other settings.
. Click **Next**.
. Review your selections. You can edit each section if necessary.
. If you are ready to deploy, click **Save & Deploy**, otherwise you can select **Save**, to save the API Instance
and deploy it at a later time.




== Promote API from Environment

== Import API from Zip File

== Create an API instance

The following procedure describes creating a single API instance from Exchange, and configuring the API instance as an endpoint with proxy:

. 
. In *API Administration*, click *Manage API*. 
. Select *Manage API From Exchange*.
. In *API name*, enter the name of your Exchange asset.
+ 
Once the asset is selected, you can choose the version of the asset to manage. 
+
. In *API version*, select the API version.
. In *Asset version*, select the Exchange asset version.
. In *Managing type*, select *Endpoint with proxy*.
+
If you choose _Endpoint with Proxy_ and do not make an entry (such as accepting the default value), you cannot save your configuration.
. In *Implementation URI*, enter your web site URL or an arbitrary URL, such as `+http://api.domain.com+`. 

. In *Client provider*, select the client provider to authenticate API access from registered client applications:
+
.Associate client provider with the API
image::create-instance-endpoint-midp.png[65%,65%, Create instances with multiple client provider]
+
* The first item under *API Configuration* is the *Add a Tag* field. Tags are optional fields.
* The second item shows the *Managing Type* field. Ensure that *Endpoint with Proxy* is selected.
* The third item shows the *Client provider* field. 
+
If no client providers are configured for your environment and organization, the *Client provider* field is not visible.

. Select a proxy deployment target, for example, *CloudHub*.
. Accept the default path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path.
. In *Advanced options*, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy (or accept the default label), and set a response timeout.
. Click *Save*.
+
. Click *API Administration* to return to the *API Administration* dashboard.

== Notes

* Although OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, the callback feature is not. To work around this issue, either handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
