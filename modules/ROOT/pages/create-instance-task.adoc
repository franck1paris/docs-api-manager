= Create an API Instance

In API Manager 2.x, instances of an API can exist in multiple environments. Additionally, you can create multiple instances of an API in the same environment. 

You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint. You can apply caching policies (for example, to the proxy), and throttling and security policies to the basic endpoint.

After setting up an API version for management, you repeat the process to create another instance. Attempting to configure the same version creates another instance of the version. You can create multiple instances and expand the version information to view details about them.

== Create an API instance

The following procedure describes creating a single API instance from Exchange, and configuring the API instance as an endpoint with proxy:

. In *API Administration*, click *Manage API*. 
. Select *Manage API From Exchange*.
. In *API name*, enter the name of your Exchange asset.
+ 
Once the asset is selected, you can choose the version of the asset to manage. 
+
. In *API version*, select the API version.
. In *Asset version*, select the Exchange asset version.
. In *Managing type*, select *Endpoint with proxy*.
+
If you choose _Endpoint with Proxy_ and do not make an entry (such as accepting the default value), you cannot save your configuration.
. In *Implementation URI*, enter your web site URL or an arbitrary URL, such as `+http://api.domain.com+`. 

. In *Client provider*, select the client provider to authenticate API access from registered client applications:
+
.Associate client provider with the API

+
* The first item under *API Configuration* is the *Add a Tag* field. Tags are optional fields.
* The second item shows the *Managing Type* field. Ensure that *Endpoint with Proxy* is selected.
* The third item shows the *Client provider* field. 
+
If no client providers are configured for your environment and organization, the *Client provider* field is not visible.

. Select a proxy deployment target, for example, *CloudHub*.
. Accept the default path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path.
. In *Advanced options*, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy (or accept the default label), and set a response timeout.
. Click *Save*.
+
. Click *API Administration* to return to the *API Administration* dashboard.

== Notes

* Although OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, the callback feature is not. To work around this issue, either handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
