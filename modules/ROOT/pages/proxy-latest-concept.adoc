You can deploy your API proxy to CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or a hybrid cloud environment. The resources allocated to the proxy application varies based on the type of proxy you are using. For example, the CloudHub proxy includes a CPU with 0.1 vCores and a memory of 500 MB, by default. 

If required, modify the resource allocation from xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-cloudhub#change-settings-of-a-deployed-application.adoc[Runtime Manager].

== Prerequisites

Before you deploy your API proxy, complete the following requirements if you work in a Runtime Fabric or hybrid cloud environment:

* Runtime Fabric
** Obtain the Manage APIs Configuration and Deploy API Proxies permissions on your account.
** Use Mule versions 3.8.7, 3.9.1, 4.1.2, or later.
* Hybrid: 
** For private servers, obtain access to a Mule runtime engine (Mule) instance configured for your organization. 
+
For information about how to configure a Mule instance as a server, see xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[register a server in Runtime Manager].
** Register your private server with a Mule agent that is compatible with your Mule instance.
+
For Mule versions 3.8 and later, use Mule Agent 1.9.0. For Mule 4.x, use the Mule Agent specified in the release notes. 

== Deploy Your API Proxy

To deploy your proxy:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *API Manager* > *Manage API* > *Manage API From Exchange*.
. In *API Name*, search for the name of the asset as saved in Exchange.
+
The *Asset type*, *API version*, and *Asset version* fields for the API are auto-populated from Exchange.
. From *Managing type*, select *Endpoint with proxy* and select the *Proxy deployment target* value for the proxy, one of *CloudHub*, *Hybrid*, or *Runtime Fabric*:
+
image:select-deployment-target.png[Select Managing type and Deployment Target,75%,75%]
+
<1> Search for APIs from Exchange.
<2> Select a proxy deployment target.
+
. If your Mule target is Mule 4, select *Mule version*; otherwise, leave it unselected.
+
If you are deploying your API to a Mule 4 environment and want to enable the proxy to support HTTPS requests, first xref:building-https-proxy.adoc[build HTTPS API proxies]. 
. In *Implementation URI*, specify the base URL path to access the proxy.
. Optionally specify advanced parameters, such as *TLS context for outbound traffic*, *Proxy version*, *Validations*, *Response timeout*, and *Port*.
. Click *Save*.
+
Your configuration information is saved and the *Deployment Configuration* section of the UI is displayed.
. In *Deployment Configuration*, specify the Mule version in *Runtime version* and the name of the proxy application in *Proxy application name*.
+
If you are updating an existing proxy application, select *Update application if it exists*.
. Click *Deploy*.
+
Your API proxy is now deployed to your selected environment. The following illustration shows an example of the screen that appears when you deploy an API proxy to CloudHub:

<2> Deployment status displayed as successful.
<3> View deployment logs in Runtime Manager.
. If you deployed your API to a Mule 3 environment, xref:enable-https-mule3-proxies.adoc[enable HTTPS in Mule 3x].
